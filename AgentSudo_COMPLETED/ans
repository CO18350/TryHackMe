when we visit the port 80 of the ip we get 


Dear agents,

Use your own codename as user-agent to access the site.

From,
Agent R 

somewhat we have to change our useragent to some character like A or B
so we get this will make a program or script to run this using curl or we can just use burp suite or devloper tools to edit this so for good practice we will be making a bash 
coudnt make abetter one even afte 15mins

we do this for all and find out that at c we do get the values we needed
curl -A A 10.10.93.161 
curl -A B 10.10.93.161

Attention chris,

Do you still remember our deal? Please tell agent J about the stuff ASAP. Also, change your god damn password, is weak!

From,
Agent R 

now we have found the username of the person and also that the password is easy to crack thus we will be using hydra to crack the password:

NOw in the task 3 we are supposed to find 5 things


#1 FTP password

as we already know abou the username so we try for chris and we use hydra command:
hydra -l chris -P /home/kali/Dictionaries/rockyou.txt ftp://10.10.93.161
Hydra v9.0 (c) 2019 by van Hauser/THC - Please do not use in military or secret service organizations, or for illegal purposes.

Hydra (https://github.com/vanhauser-thc/thc-hydra) finished at 2020-05-04 09:24:02

and we get the password as crystal


now for this we will then get the file from logging in ftp by
ftp <ip>
ftp 10.10.93.161

input the name as chris and password as crystal
and then we get all the files


we are only allowed to get 3 files?
ive saved them in the dir and now we have to use them

we have been told that 
Dear agent J,

All these alien like photos are fake! Agent R stored the real picture inside your directory. Your login password is somehow stored in the fake picture. It shouldn't be a problem for you.

From,
Agent C

now we have to get the data from the images so we will use steghide


for this we have installed stegcracker which is kept in /opt and can be run
#2 	Zip file password

first we have to file and for loacting zip filw we try to binwalk from the user images and then we find that the cutie.png has a zip file as well.

we will use binwalk
binwalk -e cutie.png 

-e is for extract and we get the 
zip file
